 <h3 align="center">From Hospitality to Web Development</h3>
 <p>
My first job ever was in a restaurant. I fell in love with the industry and immersed myself in every aspect of it and poured everything I had into it. I moved to NYC to work at the best establishments in the world and was able to work with incredibly talented, hardworking individuals.
 </p>
 <p>
As I progressed in the hospitality industry, managing teams and tackling complex challenges became part of my daily routine. It was during this time that I discovered my affinity for problem-solving, particularly through the power of technology. I found myself crafting <a href='https://www.onbarmanagement.com'>intricate spreadsheets</a> to solve problems, streamline operations and enhance efficiency. I began sharing some of these resources with my peers in the hospitality industry on a blog I created. This lead me to learn JavaScript and other web development skills to increase the types of things I was able to create and share.
</p>
<p>
Once the pandemic hit and the hospitality industry was devastated, I decided to lean into my engineering skillset. Leveraging my passion for technology and problem-solving, I focused on creating websites for businesses affected by the pandemic. Since then, I've been fully immersed in the world of web development, combining my hospitality background with engineering skills to create impactful digital solutions for my <a href='https://www.williampasternak.com'>clients</a>.
    <p>
    In my free time I develop and share free resources and tools for the hospitality industry like <a href= 'http://www.86bread.com'>bread</a>, a free, full-stack application for reviewing and sharing salary information for the hospitality industry. It is completely anonymous and crowd-sourced. Users to browse and share salary data and other company information for employees in the service industry.
